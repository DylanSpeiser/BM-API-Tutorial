        # 5. Media Management

        Welcome back! Now that we're controlling our devices over the network, it's time
        to see what we've recorded and get media from the camera and HyperDeck. But, since
        taking the physical media from the camera might be inconvenient or impossible, let's
        download it to our computer over the network.

        ## Web Media Manager

        If you noticed, in **Blackmagic Camera Setup** and **Blackmagic HyperDeck Setup**, we enabled
        the "Web Media Manager" and there is a URL listed for it. If we open this in our browser
        (which is okay to do even if the browser complains about security), we see the following:

        <img src="" alt="Web Media Manager screenshot">

        Using this web page, which is hosted on the device itself, we can download, upload, and organize media
        on any of the device's connected drives from any computer on the network. It's really convenient to download
        camera originals without having to move any cards or drives, all on your local network without being impacted by
        internet speeds which might have slowed down a transfer over the cloud.

        ## SMB

        For even more file-transfer and file-organizing power, we can access a Camera or HyperDeck's contents over SMB.
        SMB is Windows's native network file sharing protocol, and it is supported by Linux and macOS as well. To connect to
        a Blackmagic device over SMB, follow [instructions for connecting to an SMB server](https://knowledgebase.45drives.com/kb/kb450446-connecting-to-smb-share-on-windows-and-macos/).
        The devices might even show up in File Explorer or Finder automatically, making the process even easier.

        If prompted for a login, just connect as a guest. You can configure the security and login information in **Blackmagic Camera Setup**.

        > username: `guest`<br>
        > password: `guest`

        ## FTP

        FTP is another **F**ile **T**ransfer **P**rotocol. You can also connect with File Explorer or Finder, as well as dedicated FTP clients. Both FTP and SMB
        come with pros and cons, as well as security considerations. **Do not** open or expose any network ports to the open internet without taking _additional_
        security precautions. Open ports are scanned for all the time, and there is no security on BMD devices to stop bad actors from uploading malicious files to your
        device or the rest of your network.

        If you do want to access these files over the internet, consider solutions like a secure VPN connection to the network where your BMD devices are shared, or services like
        Google Drive or Blackmagic Cloud that can securely sync files over the internet.
