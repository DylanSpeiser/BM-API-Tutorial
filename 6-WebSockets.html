        # 6. WebSocket Updates

        In this article, we'll learn about WebSockets and how we can use them to keep an
        accurate record of the device's current status.

        ## What's a WebSocket?

        A WebSocket is a two-way, event-based, network communication channel. WebSockets are designed to 
        be used for web and internet applications, which is why they are particularly well suited for JavaScript.

        A WebSocket connection to a Blackmagic device involves initializing the connection,
        subscribing to the device's properties, and acting with the event's data.

        We can initialize a new WebSocket object in JavaScript by giving the constructor our device's WebSocket URL.
        The WebSocket URL looks like this:

        ```
        ws://&lt;Hostname&gt;/control/api/v1/event/websocket
        ```

        So, for me connecting to the camera, I initialize a new WebSocket object named `ws` like so:

        ```JS
        var ws = new WebSocket("ws://Studio-Camera-6K-Pro.local/control/api/v1/event/websocket");
        ```

        When we run this, it establishes a connection to the camera's WebSocket API. We can define the behavior of this
        WebSocket connection by passing functions to `ws`'s `onmessage`, `onerror`, `onopen`, and `onclose` functions.
        These functions get called when the WebSocket gets a message, encounters an error, opens a new connection, or closes one.

        To get someting basic working, we can pass a simple function to `ws.onmessage` like so:

        ```JS
        ws.onmessage = (event) => {
            console.log("WebSocket message received: ", JSON.parse(event.data));
        };
        ```

        This function just outputs the message event's data (which is a JSON string) to the console, which is good enough for this
        demonstration. Now that we've defined the behavior, let's send our first message.

        This message will ask the camera for the available properties we can subscribe to. To do this, we send the camera
        this JSON object through the WebSocket:

        ```JSON
        {type: "request", data: {action: "listProperties"}}
        ```

        ```JS
        ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: "request", data: {action: "listProperties"}}));
        ```

        If all has gone well, the console should have printed the following:

        ```
        WebSocket message received: &#8227; {data: {â€¦}, type: 'response'}
        ```

        Expanding our view of the returned JSON object, we can see that the response data
        lists the request action (`listProperties`), an array of all the properties we can subscribe to,
        and `success: true`, indicating that the request was successful.

        There isn't much documentation from Blackmagic about how this WebSocket API works, other than a Notification.yaml
        file that you can access at the same link as the other YAML documentation files: (`http://&lt;Hostname&gt;.local/control/documentation.html`).

        ## Subscriptions

        To make the data returned by the WebSocket more useful, let's make some modifications to our `ws.onmessage` function:

        ```JS
        // Array to store the properties we can subscribe to
        var availableProperties;

        ws.onmessage = (event) => {
            let eventData = JSON.parse(event.data);

            if (eventData.type == "response") {
                let messageData = eventData.data;

                if (messageData.action == "listProperties") {
                    availableProperties = messageData.properties;
                } 
            }

            console.log("WebSocket message received: ", eventData);
        }
        ```

        This `ws.onmessage` function is important, since the response from the WebSocket is only available
        within this function as `event.data`. To save the relevant information for later, I've made a special
        case for the `listProperties` action, where if a response of that kind is received, it will set a global
        variable array to reflect the properties from the camera. We can now use it to subscribe to events.

        Looking at the strings in this array, the subscribe-able camera properties have the same format as the REST API
        endpoints:

        ```JSON
        availableProperties = [
        "/audio/channel/0/available",
        "/audio/channel/0/input",
        "/audio/channel/0/level",
        ...
        "/clips/list",
        "/colorCorrection/color",
        "/colorCorrection/contrast",
        "/colorCorrection/gain",
        ...
        "/lens/focus",
        "/lens/iris",
        "/lens/zoom",
        "/media/active",
        "/media/workingset",
        "/presets",
        ...
        "/video/ndFilter/displayMode",
        "/video/shutter",
        "/video/whiteBalance",
        "/video/whiteBalanceTint"
        ]
        ```

        Let's pick one of these for now. For example, `/transports/0/record`.
        To subscribe to this property, we'll run this line of JavaScript:

        ```JS
        ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: "request", data: {action: "subscribe", properties: ["/transports/0/record"]}}));
        ```

        After running this line, we should see a message from the WebSocket come back with a response object like this:

        ```JSON
        {
            "data": {
                "action": "subscribe",
                "properties": [
                    "/transports/0/record"
                ],
                "success": true,
                "values": {
                    "/transports/0/record": {
                        "recording": false
                    }
                }
            },
            "type": "response"
        }
        ```

        Notice that the camera acknowledges that we've subscribed to the property `/transports/0/record`, and it gave us its
        current value, which is that the camera is not recording.

        Now, if we press record on the camera (either physically or over the network), new WebSocket messages should appear in the console
        whose data objects show that the camera has started recording. Because we subscribed to the recording property, the camera sent a
        WebSocket message to our computer when the camera started recording. The WebSocket arrived, called `ws.onmessage`, and our function
        output the received data to the command line.

        My returned object had this format:

        ```JSON
        {
            "data": {
                "action": "propertyValueChanged",
                "property": "/transports/0/record",
                "value": {
                    "recording": true
                }
            },
            "type": "event"
        }
        ```

        Now, by adding behavior to the `ws.onmessage` function and subscribing to more properties, we can keep our program
        synchronized with what the camera is doing. This might include updating elements on a web page, which we'll see next.

        ## Talk to the Web Page

        If we're storing data about the camera's state, we can keep it updated by checking for the `propertyValueChanged` action in `ws.onmessage`,
        then update our data as necessary. For demonstration purposes, I'll store the data in a `BMDCamera` object organized by property. I'll also
        add a `&lt;pre&gt;` HTML element with id `cameraInfo` on a web page running this script, which the new `onmessage` function will modify the contents of.
        
        Our new `onmessage` function looks like this:

        ```JS
        ws.onmessage = (event) => {
            // Parse the event's data as JSON
            let eventData = JSON.parse(event.data);

            // Extract data we really care about
            let messageData = eventData.data;

            // If it's a listProperties message, update the available properties array
            if (messageData.action == "listProperties") {
                availableProperties = messageData.properties;
            }

            // If it's a propertyValueChanged event, update the camera object accordingly.
            if (messageData.action == "propertyValueChanged") {
                camera[messageData.property] = messageData.value;
                document.getElementById("cameraInfo").innerHTML = JSON.stringify(camera, undefined, 4);
            }

            // Output info to console.
            console.log("WebSocket message received: ", eventData);
        }
        ```

        Notice that I'm using the `document.getElementById` method here. This is because I'm writing
        this script to run on a web page. If you're following along, do the same, and you'll see your
        camera's recording state update in real time as the WebSocket messages keep us informed about
        what the camera is doing. To see the full code for this small, testing web page, open [WebSocketIntro.html](examples/WebSocketIntro.html)
        in the examples folder.

        ## A Graduating Class

        Let's pull it all together by incorporating this WebSocket functionality into a new version of the
        `BMDevice` class. Remember, you can find all the code in the examples folder in the GitHub respository.

        This modified `BMDevice` class is available in `BMDevice_WS.js`, and this example is in [WebSocketPropDisplay.html](examples/WebSocketPropDisplay.html).
        The important changes are adding `ws`, `availableProperties`, and `propertyData` fields to the `BMDevice` class. I initialize the `ws` field and its behavior
        in the `BMDevice` constructor.

        The new lines in the constructor are as follows:

        ```JS
        // Initialize WebSocket
        this.ws = new WebSocket("ws://"+hostname+"/control/api/v1/event/websocket");

        // Get a self object for accessing within callback fns
        var self = this;

        // Set the onmessage behavior
        this.ws.onmessage = (event) => {
            // Parse the event's data as JSON
            let eventData = JSON.parse(event.data);

            // Extract data we really care about
            let messageData = eventData.data;

            // If it's a listProperties message, update the available properties array
            if (messageData.action == "listProperties") {
                self.availableProperties = messageData.properties;
            }

            // If we get a response from the camera with property information, save it.
            if (eventData.type == "response") {
                Object.assign(this.propertyData, messageData.values);
            }

            // If it's a propertyValueChanged event, update the camera object accordingly and show it on the web page.
            if (messageData.action == "propertyValueChanged") {
                this.propertyData[messageData.property] = messageData.value;
            }

            // Update the UI
            this.updateUI();

            // Output info to console.
            console.log("WebSocket message received: ", eventData);
        }

        // Wait for the WebSocket to open
        this.ws.onopen = (event) => {
            // Once the WebSocket is open,

            // Ask it for all the properties
            self.ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: "request", data: {action: "listProperties"}}));

            sleep(100).then(() => {
                // Subscribe to all available events
                this.availableProperties.forEach((str) => {
                    self.ws.send(JSON.stringify({type: "request", data: {action: "subscribe", properties: [str]}}));
                });
            });
        }
        ```

        To try this out yourself, open the [WebSocketPropDisplay.html](examples/WebSocketPropDisplay.html) file and replace the hostname
        in the `&lt;script&gt;` tag with your own. Once you change settings on your camera, they should update in real time on the page.
        This is also a great way to look at how the JSON data is organized.

        We finally have the foundation laid for a working WebUI. In the next article, I'll talk about how you can create one yourself and
        what I did to get mine working.
