        # 3. PUT Requests

        It's finally time to send some commands to the camera. A super simple one is `PUT /lens/focus/doAutoFocus`, but how do we send a `PUT` command?

        ## doAutoFocus

        ### JavaScript

        We can take our sendGETRequest function from before and modify it into a sendPUTRequest function. Let's see it:

        ```JS
        function sendPUTRequest(endpoint, data) {
            // Put the camera's API address in a constant
            const cameraAPIAddress = "http://studio-camera-6k-pro.local/control/api/v1";    // Remember to change this for YOUR camera's API address

            // Instantiate the XMLHttpRequest object
            let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

            // Create an object to store and return the response
            var responseObject = {};

            // Define the onload function
            xhr.onload = function() {
                if (this.status < 300) {                            // If the operation is successful
                    if (this.responseText)
                        responseObject = JSON.parse(this.responseText);     // Give the data to the responseObject
                    responseObject.status = this.status;                // Also pass along the status code for error handling
                } else {                                            // If there has been an error
                    responseObject = this;                              // Give the XMLHttpRequest data to the responseObject
                    console.error("Error ", this.status, ": ", this.statusText);    // Log the error in the console
                }
            };

            // Open the connection
            // The "false" here specifies that we want to wait for the response to come back before returning from xhr.send()
            xhr.open("PUT", cameraAPIAddress+endpoint, false);

            // Send the request with data
            xhr.send(data);

            // Return response data
            return responseObject;
        }
        ```

        Notice the new parameter, `data`. We can pass a JSON object into this parameter that will get sent to the camera for commands
        that require data values.

        `PUT /lens/focus/doAutoFocus` doesn't have any data, though, so we can call the function and pass an empty JSON Object in for the `data` argument, like so:

        ```JS
        sendPUTRequest("/lens/focus/doAutoFocus","{}");
        ```

        The camera usually responds to `PUT` requests with `204: No Content`, so there will be no JSON data to parse from the responseText.
        That is why we had to add the line `if (this.responseText)` to the code. Even though the function only returns `{"status": 204}`, if you look at
        the camera feed as you send the command, you can catch the camera auto-focusing!

        > **Note:** Any lens control commands will require a lens with electronic control pins that connect to the camera. Many lenses, especially ones
        > designed for cinema cameras, do not have these electronic connections, and so will not work with the API.
        
        ### Python

        Just like the JavaScript, we can modify our sendGETRequest function into a sendPUTRequest one. The Python version looks like:

        ```Python
        import requests

        def sendPUTRequest(endpoint, data):
            # Store the API Address
            cameraAPIAddress = "http://Studio-Camera-6K-Pro.local/control/api/v1"    # Remember to change this for YOUR camera's API address

            # Send the request
            response = requests.put(cameraAPIAddress+endpoint, json=data)

            # Handle errors and return
            return response
        ```

        Because the camera doesn't return any data on a successful `PUT`, we can just return the `response` object and leave the error handling for later.
        Let's run this now with the `doAutoFocus` endpoint and empty `dict` object in the data argument:

        ```python
        sendPUTRequest("/lens/focus/doAutoFocus", {})
        ```

        And we get a response object as a return value, that when running in interactive mode shows up as `&lt;Response [204]&gt;`. Hopefully, the camera did the auto focus too.

        ## ISO

        So we've gotten the camera to auto focus, but what about a PUT request that has some data, like changing the ISO? Consulting the documentation, we can see that a
        `PUT /video/iso` API call will have one integer parameter named `'iso'`. Here's how we can send a command to change the ISO in both JS and Python using our sendPUTRequest functions:

        ```JavaScript
        sendPUTRequest("/video/iso", "{\"iso\": 1600}");                // Set the ISO to 1600
        sendPUTRequest("/video/iso", JSON.stringify({iso: 1600}));      // Alternate way of passing JSON to data argument
        ```

        > (XMLHttpRequest.send(data) takes the JSON data as a string, and the way we wrote our sendPUTRequest function does not convert the argument to a string automatically.
        That is why we must either use `\"` to add quotes within a string we pass to the function or call `JSON.stringify()`)

        ```Python
        sendPUTRequest("/video/iso", {'iso': 3200})                     # Set the ISO to 3200
        ```

        Now that we know how to send JSON data to specific endpoints, let's try changing some other settings!

        ## White Balance

        White Balance is another easy setting to change, since it is just one value. We can do it like this:

        ```JavaScript
        sendPUTRequest("/video/whiteBalance", "{\"whiteBalance\": 3200}");                // Set WB to 3200K
        ```

        ```Python
        sendPUTRequest("/video/whiteBalance", {'whiteBalance': 5600})                     # Set WB to 5600K
        ```

        ## Iris
        
        The iris data from the camera is more complex than just one number. Do we want to set a specific f-stop? Do we want to set it as a percentage of fully open/closed?
        The API allows us to send a `PUT` request with just one of these values, and it will interpret it for us.

        If we want to set the iris to exactly f/8, we can do that with our JavaScript function like this:

        ```JavaScript
        sendPUTRequest("/lens/iris", "{\"apertureStop\": 8}");                // Set iris to f/8
        ```

        If we want to open the iris as much as possible, wait one second, and then fully close it, we can do it (shown in Python) like this:

        ```Python
        sendPUTRequest("/lens/iris", {'normalised': 0})                     # Fully open iris
        time.sleep(1)
        sendPUTRequest("/lens/iris", {'normalised': 1})                     # Fully close iris
        ```

        ## Record

        Now this is a setting that you'll find useful. The camera's current recording state can be `GET` and `PUT` at the endpoint `/transports/0/record`. Looking
        at the documentation, the `PUT /transports/0/record` command has an extra parameter: a name for the new clip. That's really cool, since that is only
        possibly by using this API. Let's write JavaScript and Python functions to toggle the recording state of the camera and set a custom file name:

        ```JS
        function toggleRecord(filename="") {
            // First, get whether or not the camera is recording right now
            var recordingState = sendGETRequest("/transports/0/record");
        
            // Boolean invert the recording state
            recordingState.recording = !recordingState.recording;
        
            // If a file name was specified, add that to the dict as "clipName"
            if (filename) {
                recordingState.clipName = filename;
            }
        
            // PUT the data back on the camera
            sendPUTRequest("/transports/0/record",JSON.stringify(recordingState));
        }
        ```

        ```Python
        def toggleRecord(filename=""):
            # First, get whether or not the camera is recording right now
            recordingState = sendGETRequest("/transports/0/record")
        
            # Boolean invert the recording state
            recordingState["recording"] = not (recordingState["recording"])
        
            # If a file name was specified, add that to the dict as "clipName"
            if (len(filename) > 0):
                recordingState["clipName"] = filename
        
            # PUT the data back on the camera
            sendPUTRequest("/transports/0/record",recordingState)
        ```

        Try it out! Now that you know how to `GET` data, modify the `dict` and JSON data, and `PUT` it back on the camera, try writing your own functions and scripts
        to control the settings you want! The possibilities are literally endless.

        Some endpoints in the API specify that they use the `POST` method. If that's one of the settings you care about, write a sendPOSTRequest function.

        In the next article, we'll organize all this data and these functions, allowing control of _multiple_ devices! Let's go!
